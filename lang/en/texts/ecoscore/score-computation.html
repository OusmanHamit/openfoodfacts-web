<h1>Score calculation</h1>
<p>The following formula makes it possible to obtain the transport score on 100 points, taking into account a number</p>
<p>not</p>
<p>not of ingredients involved in a recipe:</p>
<p>score=\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i*p_i</p>
<p>score= i=1</p>
<p>∑ not at i</p>
<p>∗p i</p>
<p>not</p>
<p>not the number of ingredients</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>at</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>the transport score associated with the country or fishing area</p>
<p>p_i</p>
<p>p</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>the percentage of the ingredient present in the recipe</p>
<p>The sum of the percentages is always equal to 100:</p>
<p>\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_i=100</p>
<p>∑</p>
<p>i=1</p>
<p>not</p>
<p>p</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>=100</p>
<p>The transport score is integrated into the overall product score in the form of a bonus of up to 15 points. The transport bonus is calculated as follows:</p>
<p>bonus=x*0.15</p>
<p>bonus=x∗0.15</p>
<p>x</p>
<p>x corresponds to the transport score</p>
