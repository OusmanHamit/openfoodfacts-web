<h1>Presentation</h1>
<p>Welcome to the documentation of the "Eco-score" environmental rating.</p>
<p>The Eco-score is an indicator representing the environmental impact of food products. It classifies products into 5 categories (A, B, C, D, E), from the lowest impact to the highest impact.</p>
<p>The environmental impact takes into account several factors on air, water, ocean and soil pollution, as well as impacts on the biosphere:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Greenhouse gas emissions (CO2)</li>
  <li>Ozone layer destruction</li>
  <li>Fine particle emissions</li>
  <li>Photochemical oxidation</li>
  <li>Acidification</li>
  <li>Radioactivity</li>
  <li>Depletion of water resources</li>
  <li>Freshwater pollution</li>
  <li>Depletion of non-renewable resources&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Eutrophication (terrestrial, freshwater & marine)</li>
  <li>Land use</li>
  <li>Toxicities (freshwater & human)</li>
  <li>Loss of biodiversity</li>
</ul>
<p>The impacts are studied throughout the product's life cycle:</p>
<p>Impacts that are taken into account in the Eco-score</p>
<h1>Objective of the process</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Food is the main sector responsible for climate change. Globally, it represents 28% of greenhouse gas emissions, 70% of drinking water consumption and the majority of packaging waste.</li>
  <li>Agriculture occupies 1/3 of the land surface on the planet and it is also the main factor of deforestation, but it is possible to drastically reduce its impact by consuming differently.</li>
  <li>The starting point of this approach is to have enlightened information on the environmental impacts of the products consumed. The ambition of the Eco-score is to be a decision-making tool in order to guide our food choices towards a more sustainable mode of consumption.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>By encouraging more virtuous agricultural practices and choosing a diet that preserves our environment, we can thus actively contribute to preserving resources, containing global warming below 2° C and preserving life for future generations.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Engaged actors</h1>
<p>The Eco-score is jointly offered by several digital players who share the common ambition to set up a simple tool to reduce the impact of food on the planet:</p>
