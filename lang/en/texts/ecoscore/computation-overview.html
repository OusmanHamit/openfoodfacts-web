<h1>General operation</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The calculation of the Eco-score is based on the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). It also mobilizes additional indicators to form a score out of 100.</li>
  <li>This score is displayed as letters, from A to E.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Basis of reference: Life cycle analysis</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a standardized, multi-criteria, and multi-step environmental assessment methodology. It is widely used in the scientific world to assess impacts on the environment.</li>
  <li>LCAs for each product category have been carried out by ADEME (the Ecological Transition Agency) as part of the <a href="https://ecolab.ademe.fr/agribalyse">Agribalyse</a> project : they assess the environmental impacts of 2,500 product categories.
  </li>
  <li>The LCA is integrated into the Eco-score in the form of a score out of 100 points.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>It represents the basic basis of the rating, to which are added additional indicators, detailed below.</li>
  <li>The ACV score is based solely on the type of product (chocolate cookie, 4 cheese pizza, tomato sauce, etc.). It is identical for all the products of the same category, unless the user is able to recalculate the entire recipe.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Complementary indicators</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The additional indicators make it possible to capture other environmental issues not represented by LCA, such as biodiversity, the protection of endangered species, or even local supply. They complete the score to allow a wider field of factors to be covered.</li>
  <li>These indicators are based on the specific characteristics of the product (labels, packaging, origin, etc.). Thus, it allows to compare products within the same category, for example, several chocolate cookies between them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1. Production system</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In the current state of knowledge, LCA indicators are not sufficient to compare production systems (organic farming versus conventional farming, for example). They do not understand, for example, the issues linked to biodiversity, or to the impact of phytosanitary products on ecosystems (water in particular).</li>
  <li>The labels that may be present (Bio, Demeter, Rainforest, etc.) allow bonuses to be obtained, depending on the level of environmental benefits they represent.</li>
  <li>This criterion is integrated in the form of a bonus: from 5 to 20 points.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Local procurement</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Agribalyse LCA does not capture the precise origin of the ingredients for a given product. They use origin mixes to assess the impact of "average" transport.</li>
  <li>As part of the Eco-score, the origin of each ingredient in a product is collected. It makes it possible to precisely modulate the score of each product according to the origin of each ingredient.</li>
  <li>This criterion is integrated in the form of a bonus: from 0 to 15 points.</li>

<h2>3. Environmental policy</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The average Agribalyse data does not fully capture the differences linked to the country of production. In order to reflect the country's environmental policy (discharge standards, electricity production, biodiversity, etc.), the Eco-score is adjusted according to the producer countries.</li>
  <li>This criterion is integrated in the form of a bonus / penalty: from -5 to +5 points.</li>

<h2>4. Circularity of the packaging</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Good packaging practices (recyclability, reduction of packaging, integration of recycled raw materials, etc.) are poorly represented in LCAs. A packaging score is calculated to reflect the level of circularity of the packaging. The objective is to enhance the recyclability of packaging, and its production from recycled raw material ("closed loop" system). Conversely, this criterion devalues packaging made from non-renewable and non-recyclable resources.</li>
  <li>This criterion is integrated in the form of a penalty: from 0 to -15 points.</li>
  <li>Special case</li>
  <li>Only products packaged in recyclable (or biodegradable) packaging are eligible for the Eco-score A, regardless of other criteria.</li>

<h2>5. Threatened species</h2>
<p>LCAs do not capture the issues related to biodiversity. To date, 2 criteria have been taken into account:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The depletion of the fish stock, leading to the risk of the disappearance of certain species due to overfishing</li>
  <li>Massive deforestation linked to oil palm cultivation leading to the risk of the disappearance of many species (primates, tigers, birds)</li>
</ul>
<p>This criterion is integrated in the form of a penalty of -10 points.</p>
