<h1>Synthesis</h1>
<p>The Eco-score consists of a score out of 100 calculated from the category of the product, supplemented by additional indicators relating to the specificities of the product in question. It is calculated by adding all the components:</p>
<p>score = ACV + bonus - penalty</p>
<p>The score out of 100 determines the associated Eco-score letter:</p>

<h1>Life cycle analysis</h1>
<p>Relative to product category</p>
<p>The majority of the environmental impacts of a food product occur during the agricultural production phase.</p>
<p>For the Eco-score, the Production score corresponds both to agricultural production ("leaving the farm") but also to the processing steps required for processed products ("leaving the factory").</p>
<h1>Agribalyse v3</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The LCA score is calculated from data from the AGRIBALYSE program, the reference environmental database on agricultural and food products:</li>
  <ul>

      <a href="https://ecolab.ademe.fr/agribalyse">ecolab.ademe.fr</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>AGRIBALYSE is a French government program, supported by ADEME: the Ecological Transition Agency.</li>
  <li>Agribalyse LCAs take into account all stages of the life cycle analysis (upstream agricultural, processing, transport, packaging, use, end of life) for the main categories of food products.</li>
  <li>More than a hundred scientists have contributed to this program, which has been in existence since 2009 and whose latest version (v3) has been accessible to all since September 2019.</li>
  <li>The Agribalyse methodology is detailed below:</li>

    <li>
      <a href="https://ecolab.gitbook.io/documentation-agribalyse/">ecolab.gitbook.io</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>As Agribalyse data is based on average information by product category, it does not currently allow comparison of products in the same category. Thus, two food products of the same category will have an equivalent LCA score even if their recipes, production methods, origin, packaging are noticeably different.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Indicators</h1>
<p>16 indicators are taken into account for the calculation. They correspond to those recommended by the <a href="https://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/EnvironmentalFootprint.html">European Commission</a> within the framework of work on the Product Environmental Footprint project.</p>

<h1>Weighting</h1>
<p>The 16 indicators are weighted according to the importance of the environmental issues they represent.</p>
<p>The weighting results from a broad consultation of 2 distinct groups:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Population: 2,400 people across 6 European countries</li>
  <li>Scientific experts: 518 experts across 48 countries</li>
</ul>
<p>Each group weighs the different indicators according to the importance of the associated environmental issues. The final weighting results from the aggregation of the 2 groups (at 50/50), as well as the taking into account of the level of robustness of each indicator.</p>


[[ecoscore/agribalyse-impact-table.html]]

<p>This methodology corresponds to that proposed by the European Commission in order to arrive at a single score ("Single Score").</p>

<h1>Standardization</h1>
<h3>Single Score</h3>
<ul>
  <li>For each product category, a single score ("Single Score") is calculated from the 16 impact indicators. It is expressed in points (Pts) per 100g of finished product. The higher this score, the greater the impact on the environment. 1 point corresponds to the average environmental impact of a European citizen over 1 year (in 2010). For a food product, this score is generally between ~ 0 (no impact) and 0.004 point (very significant impacts) per kilo of finished products as consumed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Score / 100</h3>
<h3>As part of the Eco-score, this score is converted to a scale from 0 to 100 in order to make it easier to read.</h3>
<p>The 100-point normalization follows the following formula:</p>
<p>General case</p>
<p>Drinks</p>
<p>x</p>
<p>x is the Single Score of the product concerned, expressed in milipoints (mPt) per 1kg</p>
<ul>
  <li>The score is bounded in the interval [0, 100].</li>
</ul>
<p>The formula follows a logarithmic, nonlinear curve. A logarithmic scale is particularly suitable for accounting for orders of magnitude in applications. It shows a wide range of values in a small space. It is thus possible to compare vegetables with each other, as well as red meats, on a single scale of 100 points.</p>

<p>Bonuses are cumulative, up to a limit of 25 points. Each indicator is rounded to the nearest whole number.</p>
<h1>Production system</h1>
<p>Taking into account the environmental benefits linked to labels</p>
<p>Labeled products benefit from a bonus ranging from 10 to 20 points depending on the level of commitment and the estimated environmental benefits they represent. The level of benefit is determined on the basis of the scientific literature available to date: LCA, climate change indicators, phytosanitary treatments, eutrophication, impact on biodiversity, carbon storage in soils, impacts on deforestation, etc. (see sources).</p>
<p>If the labels are cumulative, the associated points are added up to a limit of 20 points, except for the ASC / MSC labels which cannot be combined with each other.</p>

<h1>Local procurement</h1>
<p>Rules for calculating the transport score</p>
<p>A transport score is assigned to each country in order to promote local supply. It is constructed by calculating the carbon impact of the journey of goods between the country of origin and France.</p>
<p>The carbon impact of this trip depends on 2 criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the distance between the origin and the destination</li>
  <li>the mode(s) of transport used</li>
</ul>
<p>The calculation method and the assumptions related to these criteria are detailed below.</p>
<h1>Distances</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The distance between the country of origin and the country of destination is calculated from the geographical center of the country of departure and that of France.</li>
  <li>For each rail or sea route, 2 truck journeys are taken into account: one in the country of origin between its geographical center and its nearest place of embarkation, the other in France between its place of disembarkation on closer and the center of France.</li>
  <li>The routes were established using the following tools:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Road: <a href="https://www.google.fr/maps">Google Maps</a>
  </li>
  <li>Rail: <a href="https://www.ecotransit.org/calculation.fr.html">EcoTransIT</a>
  </li>
  <li>Maritime: <a href="https://www.searates.com/services/distances-time/">Searates</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1>Modes of transport</h1>
<p>For European countries, the score is weighted according to the mode of transport used between the country of origin and France.</p>
<p>Modal mix of freight transport to France - EuroStat data (2006)</p>
<ul>
  <li>For countries outside Europe, the modal mix considered is 100% maritime.</li>
  <li>Air and river transport modes were excluded due to their low representativeness (0.1% and 3.4% respectively) - EuroStat 2016 data</li>
</ul>
<h1>CO2 impact measurement</h1>
<p>The CO2 impact data (in gCO2e/t.km) come from the <a href="https://www.bilans-ges.ademe.fr/fr/basecarbone/donnees-consulter/choix-categorie/siGras/1">Carbon Base</a> (ADEME).</p>

[[ecoscore/transportation-mode-impact-table.html]]

<p>The CO2 impact of rail in France is low because electricity comes mainly from nuclear power plants (78%).</p>

  <li>Transport scoreboard by country & fishing areas</li>
  <li>The transport score makes it possible to account for the environmental impacts linked to the distance and the means of transport used to transport an ingredient to its place of transformation or distribution.</li>
  <li>It is based either on the country of production or on the <a href="https://docs.score-environnemental.com/methodologie/produit/transport/synthese#zones-de-peche">fishing zone</a> for wild fishery resources.
  </li>
</ul>

[[ecoscore/score-by-country-table.html]]


<h1>Fishing areas</h1>
<p>For wild fishery resources, the fishing zone (FAO) is considered rather than the flag of the vessel to determine the transport score.</p>

[[ecoscore/fishing-areas-table.html]]


<h1>Environmental policy</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Original score calculation rule</li>
  <li>The assessment of environmental policies is hereinafter referred to as the "origin score". Its objective is to report on the policy of the producing country in terms of the environment (discharge standards, electricity production, biodiversity, etc.). It is established on the basis of the work of the Environmental Performance Index (EPI).</li>
</ul>
<h1>Environmental Performance Index</h1>
<p>The EPI is an index created by researchers at Yale University and Columbia to determine the performance of each country's environmental policies and its impact on the environment.</p>
<p>An update is published every two years on the site: <a href="https://epi.yale.edu/">https://epi.yale.edu/</a></p>
<p>It brings together 180 countries and aggregates 32 performance indicators grouped into 11 categories:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Air quality</li>
  <li>Water quality</li>
  <li>Heavy metals</li>
  <li>Waste management</li>
  <li>Biodiversity & habitat</li>
  <li>Ecosystem management</li>
  <li>Peach</li>
  <li>Climate change</li>
  <li>Pollutant emissions</li>
  <li>Agriculture</li>
  <li>Water resources</li>
</ol>
<p>Indicators taken into account & weighting</p>
<h1>Standardization</h1>
<p>The original score (out of 100) is normalized on a scale of 0 to 100 with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>100 → the highest rated country's PPE</li>
  <li>0 → the world average of PPE</li>
</ul>
<p>This means for example that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The country with the best PPE (Denmark) has a score of 100/100</li>
  <li>A country that has PPE less than or equal to the world average at a score of 0/100</li>
</ul>
<p>The normalization formula is as follows:</p>
<p>score=\frac{x-\overline{epi}}{epi_a-\overline{epi}}*100</p>
<p>score=</p>
<p>epi</p>
<p>at</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>epi</p>
<p>x-</p>
<p>epi</p>
<p>∗100</p>
<ul>
  <li>x</li>
  <li>x is the PPE of the country concerned</li>
  <li>\overline{epi}</li>
  <li>epi</li>
  <li>&nbsp;is the world average of PPE (46.6 in 2020)</li>
  <li>epi_a</li>
  <li>e p i</li>
  <li>at</li>
  <li>is the country with the best score (Denmark - 82.5 in 2020)</li>
</ul>
<p>The score is bounded in the interval [0, 100]</p>

<h1>Score calculation</h1>
<p>The following formula makes it possible to obtain the original score out of 100 points, taking into account a number</p>
<p>not</p>
<p>not of ingredients involved in a recipe:</p>
<p>score=\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i*p_i</p>
<p>score=</p>
<p>i=1</p>
<p>∑</p>
<p>not</p>

<p>the origin score associated with the country</p>
<p>p_i</p>
<p>p</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>the percentage of the ingredient present in the recipe</p>
<p>The sum of the percentages is always equal to 100:</p>

<p>∑</p>
<p>i=1</p>
<p>not</p>
<p>p</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>=100</p>
<p>The original score is integrated into the overall score of the product in the form of a bonus / penalty: between -5 and +5 points. The original bonus / penalty is calculated as follows:</p>
<p>bonus=\frac{x}{10}-5</p>
<p>bonus=</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>x</p>
<p>-5</p>

<h1>Circularity of the packaging</h1>
<p>Rules for calculating the packaging score</p>
<p>Food packaging can have many negative impacts on the environment, especially when it is not recycled. These impacts are linked to several factors: extraction of non-renewable fossil or mineral raw materials, water consumption, persistence in the environment, decomposition into micro and nanoparticles, contamination of soils, fresh water and oceans, etc.</p>
<p>The packaging score aims to promote the circularity of packaging and, failing that, the use of renewable and biodegradable resources. The objective is to promote packaging which benefits from a second life, and which can be reused for the same uses (in "closed loop"). This limits the extraction of virgin raw material to manufacture new single-use packaging.</p>
<p>The Packaging score consists of 2 parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>an Upstream score evaluating the origin of the raw materials used</li>
  <li>a Downstream score evaluating the different end-of-life scenarios</li>
</ul>
<h1>Upstream Score</h1>
<p>For the upstream part, we consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The possible use of recycled raw material</li>
  <li>The renewable nature or not of the raw materials</li>
  <li>Sustainable or unsustainable management of resources</li>
</ul>
<h1>Upstream score</h1>
<p>Assessment of the origin of the raw materials used in the packaging</p>
<h1>Incorporation of recycled raw materials (A)</h1>
<p>The integration of recycled raw materials makes it possible to avoid the extraction of virgin raw materials, giving a second life to the materials. From an environmental point of view, this is the most interesting option.</p>
<p>For each material, the average incorporation rate is used:</p>


[[ecoscore/packaging-average-incorporation-rate-table.html]]

<p>Source: ADEME. (2017, May). National Recycling Report 2005-2014.</p>
<p>When the information is available, the incorporation rate communicated by the brand will be used. For example, some water bottles are made from 100% recycled plastic, so this percentage will be used instead of the industry average (25%).</p>

<h1>Renewable & sustainable raw material (B)</h1>
<p>For renewable materials, sustainability labels make it possible to guarantee a more respectful management of resources, for example by guaranteeing the reforestation of forests (FSC) or by reducing greenhouse gas emissions (BonSucro).</p>
<p>The labels taken into account are:</p>

[[ecoscore/packaging-labels-table.html]]

<h1>Renewable raw material (C)</h1>
<p>The renewable materials used for food packaging are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wood (cardboard, paper, kraft, wood)</li>
  <li>Biobased plastic, made from agricultural production, without fossil resources</li>
</ul>

<h1>Non-renewable raw material (D)</h1>
<p>The so-called "non-renewable" raw materials are those whose stocks take several million years to be reconstituted: they are therefore finite resources on a human scale.</p>
<p>In food, there are 5 non-renewable materials:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Plastics (from petroleum)</li>
  <li>Metals (aluminum, steel)</li>
  <li>Glass (sand)</li>
  <li>Ceramics (clay)</li>
  <li>Wax (from petroleum)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Upstream Score</h1>
<p>To calculate the upstream score, points are assigned according to the origin of the raw materials, from the most favorable option (recycled raw material) to the most unfavorable option (non-renewable raw material).</p>

[[ecoscore/packaging-upstream-score-table.html]]


<p>The upstream score corresponds to the sum of the points awarded. He expresses himself on 100.</p>
<p>score=A*1+B*0.75+C*0.5+D*0</p>
<p>score=AT∗1+B∗0.75+VS∗0.5+D∗0</p>
<p>AT</p>
<p>AT % of incorporation of recycled raw materials</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>B the% of renewable and sustainable raw material</p>
<p>VS</p>
<p>VS the% of non-sustainable renewable raw material</p>
<p>D</p>
<p>D the% of non-renewable raw material</p>
<p>The sum of the 4 possible origins (A, B, C, D) must always be equal to 100%</p>
<h1>Synthesis by materials</h1>

[[ecoscore/upstream-score-synthesis-by-materials.html]]

<h1>Downstream score</h1>
<p>Packaging end-of-life evaluation</p>
<h1>Recyclable (A)</h1>
<p>The recyclability of packaging is the first criterion taken into account in the Downstream score. It is the most virtuous end of life because it transforms waste into a resource.</p>
<p>There are 2 cases:</p>
<p>Recyclable packaging throughout France (steel cans, aluminum cans, glass bottles, etc.). In this case the packaging is 100% recyclable.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Recyclable packaging only in certain municipalities (certain plastics, small metal packaging, etc.). In this case, the packaging is recyclable in the same proportions as the population having access to it.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Biodegradable (B)</h1>
<p>Packaging which decomposes in a natural environment is considered to be biodegradable. This is the case, for example, for wood which does not have a recycling channel in France, but which is biodegradable.</p>
<p>Compostable packaging in an industrial environment is not considered here, since no sector currently exists in France.</p>
<h1>Incineration and landfill (C)</h1>
<p>When packaging is not recyclable, it is incinerated or stored in landfills.</p>
<p>During incineration, the energy generated from the combustion of waste is then used to supply the district heating network (hospitals, swimming pools, businesses, etc.), or else converted into electricity.</p>
<p>When the packaging is not incinerated, it is stored in landfills. It is the least favorable end of life because, in the long term, it contributes to soil and water pollution.</p>
<h1>Downstream Score</h1>
<p>To calculate the downstream score, points are assigned according to the end of life of the packaging, from the most favorable option (recyclable) to the most unfavorable option (incineration or landfill).</p>

[[ecoscore/packaging-downstream-score-table.html]]

<p>The downstream score corresponds to the sum of the points awarded. He expresses himself on 100.</p>
<p>score=A*1+B*0.5+C*0</p>
<p>score=AT∗1+B∗0.5+VS∗0</p>
<p>AT</p>
<p>AT the% of recyclable material</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>B the% of biodegradable material</p>
<p>VS</p>
<p>VS % of material incinerated or landfilled</p>
<p>The sum of the percentages (A, B, C, D) must always be equal to 100%.</p>
<h1>Synthesis by materials</h1>

<h1>Score by materials</h1>
<p>Scoreboard by packaging</p>
<p>The score by material is the average of the upstream & downstream scores detailed above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The associated penalty is rounded to the nearest whole number.</p>

<h1>Ratios by format</h1>

[[ecoscore/packaging-ratio-by-format.html]]

<h1>Threatened species</h1>
<p>Malus associated with the presence of an ingredient that strongly threatens a species.</p>
<h1>Threatened fish</h1>
<p>Globally, 31% of marine populations are overexploited¹, and the situation is particularly critical in the Mediterranean, where this figure climbs to 93%. Fighting overfishing is a major issue to preserve marine species and allow this resource to be sustainable.</p>
<p>Thus, for all fish-based products, an assessment of the state of the stocks is established on the basis of 2 criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>L’espèce de poisson</li>
  <li>La zone de pêche (FAO)</li>
</ul>
<p>L’évaluation du stock pour chaque espèce est disponible dans le fichier ci-dessous :</p>

<p>If the product contains a non-sustainable species, the product obtains the Eco-score (E), regardless of other criteria.</p>
<p>Special cases</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the fishing area is unknown and the species is threatened in at least one area, the most conservative hypothesis is retained, and the product is noted E</li>
  <li>If the species is unknown, the product is noted E</li>
  <li>For sub-areas (eg "Bay of Biscay"), in the absence of more precise information on the fishing area, the default choice âœ…OK or âŒKO is considered as indicated in the file.</li>
</ul>
<p>L’évaluation de la durabilité des stocks de poissons sauvages est établie à partir de 3 sources complémentaires :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ethic Ocean ( <a href="http://guidedesespeces.org/fr">http://guidedesespeces.org/fr</a> )

  </li>
  <li>IFREMER ( <a href="https://wwz.ifremer.fr/">https://wwz.ifremer.fr/</a> )
  </li>
</ul>
<p>This criterion applies to all products with an overall content of wild fish, crustaceans or molluscs of 30% or more. Farmed fish (aquaculture) are not concerned by this criterion.</p>
<h1>Palm oil: -10 points</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Palm oil is today the most consumed oil in the world (38%). The oil palm cultivation that it involves strongly threatens many species: orangutans, gibbons, rhinos, elephants, tigers, birds, etc.</li>
  <li>To take into account the biodiversity deficit linked to oil palm cultivation and promote a more sustainable oil supply, a penalty of 10 points is applied to all products containing palm oil.</li>
</ul>
<h2>RSPO</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The 10-point penalty does not apply if the palm oil used is sustainable, i.e. 100% RSPO Segregated (SG) and / or Identity Preserved (IP) certified.</li>
  <li>There are 4 levels of RSPO certification. Two of them guarantee that the palm oil of the product is sustainable (Identity Preserved and Segregated), while the other two are compensation and support mechanisms for the sector that do not guarantee the absence of deforestation. For this reason, they are not taken into account in the Eco-score.</li>
